## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Solidity**: Ensure you have Solidity installed. The recommended version is 0.8.x or higher.
  - Solidity using [solc](https://soliditylang.org/installing-solidity.html)
  - Solidity using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- **Node.js and npm**: For testing and running Solidity code locally using frameworks like Hardhat or Foundry.

<br/>

### Running the Challenges

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/passandscore/solidity-challenges.git
   cd solidity-challenges
   ```

2. **Explore a Challenge**

   Navigate to the desired challenge folder:

   ```bash
   cd challenges/Challenge_01
   ```

3. **Compile and Test the Challenge**

   You can use tools like Remix IDE or a local development environment to compile and test your Solidity code. For Remix:

   - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Load the `Challenge.sol` file.
   - Compile and deploy the contract.

<br/>
<br/>

## Providing Solutions

After working on a challenge, you can share your solution in the Discussions section. 

> **Note**: Look for the `Solutions` discussion thread for each challenge to share your solutions.

This is a great way to get feedback, learn from others, and engage with the community. We encourage you to provide detailed explanations of your solutions to help others understand your thought process. 

üëâ We will be revealing the official solutions in the subsequent challenges.

<br/>
<br/>

## Submitting Your Own Challenge

We encourage the community to contribute by submitting new challenges. Follow these steps to submit your challenge:

1. **Create a New Folder**

   - Create a new folder named `New_Challenge`.

   ```bash
   mkdir new_challenge
   cd new_challenge
   ```

2. **Add Challenge File**

   - Create a `Challenge.sol` file with the challenge.

3. **Write a Description**

   - Add a `README.md` file within your challenge folder describing the challenge, including:

   - **Problem Statement**: What needs to be solved.
   - **Constraints**: Any specific constraints or requirements.
   - **Hints**: Optional hints to guide others.

4. **Open a Pull Request**

   - Fork this repository.
   - Create a new branch from `main`.
   - Add your challenge.
   - Open a pull request to merge your changes.

5. **Discuss Your Challenge**

      - Engage with the community in the Discussions section to discuss your challenge and solutions.

6. **Provide The Solution**

      - After a week, provide the solution to your challenge in a new PR.
      - If no solution is provided, the maintainers will provide one based on community feedback.

<br/>

### Example Challenge Description

**README.md** inside `Challenge_01`:

```markdown
# Challenge 01

## Problem Statement

You need to copy an array of structs from `calldata` to `storage`. However, directly assigning a `calldata` array to a `storage` array results in a compilation error.

**Task**:
- Refactor the given contract to manually copy the struct array from `calldata` to `storage`.
- Provide your solution and comments in the Discussion for this challenge.

**Constraints**:
- Use Solidity 0.8.x or higher.

**Author**: [Your GitHub Username]

```


<br/>
<br/>
